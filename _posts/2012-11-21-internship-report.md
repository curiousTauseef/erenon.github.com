I've finally got the approval to publish my summer internship report done at Morgan Stanley this year. I've enjoyed every minutes of it.
The paper is mainly about the _deadlock hunter_ software I've developed from scratch. Because of the [university regulations][1] it's utterly long -- a perfect fairy tale
for your little brother to fell asleep faster than ever.

Check out the [report][2] at scribid. (It's in hungarian)
