I was lucky enough (I'm looking at you, fortune cookie master) to recieve this nice _Best Tabletopic Speaker_ trophy
at Morgan Stanley Budapest Toastmasters by giving a short improvised speach.

I'd like to say thanks to my fellow toastmasters, and special thanks goes to Steve D. Nelson who was patient enough to teach me.
